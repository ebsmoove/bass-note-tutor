# Bass Note Tutor

A React application where music students can learn the notes of a musical staff, using an interactive instrument.

This application utilizes the third party libraries [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) for audio sampling and [VexFlow](https://vexflow.com/) for musical staff display.


This current app serves as a stepping stone towards  development of a full-stack education platform. Future goals  for the application involve more user integration, tutorial customization, lesson tracking and data storage. 


### Getting Started
Simply run `npm start` within the project directory to run the application in development mode.
