# Bass Note Tutor

A [React](https://reactjs.org/) application where music students can learn the notes of a musical staff, using an interactive instrument.

This application utilizes the third party libraries [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) for audio sampling and [VexFlow](https://vexflow.com/) for musical staff display.


This current app serves as a stepping stone towards  development of a full-stack educational platform. Future goals  for the application involve more user integration, tutorial customization, lesson tracking and data storage. 


### Getting Started
Simply run `npm start` within the project directory to run the application in development mode.

For more information, refer to the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).


### How To Use The Tutor 

The application initially prompts the user with a musical question involving a random note on the bass clef. The user then uses interactive *neck* to choose the correct answer. 

Once the user determines the correct answer, they are able to move on to another question. The user can also change the note format from flats to sharps if desired.
